TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.


```java
public class Codec {

  // Encodes a URL to a shortend URL.
  public String encode(String longUrl) {

  }

  //Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL
  public String decode(String shortUrl) {

  }
}
```
