关于模拟国际象棋的问题.

Say you just started playing chess against your opponent, and it seems to be going great - you have played 20 moves and already taken five pieces from your opponent. The game hasn't ended yet, so you're not 100% sure you'll win, but it seems likely. What cumulative reward have you received so far?

the reward is 0.
