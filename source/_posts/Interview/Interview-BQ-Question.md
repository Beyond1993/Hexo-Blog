## Customer Obsession
email notification for one customer for unsupported Deal

merge tab

## Ownership





回答BQ 的时候，一定要简明扼要，逻辑性强。
最重要的三点:

**Customer Obsession** : email notification, invalid deals, for one Client

**Ownership** : Oncall in the big team, after quick fix, invalid request. use more elegant way to solve it after oncall. write document

**Invent and Simplify** : compare tool

**Are Right, A Lot** : small job duplication

**Learn and Be Curious** : Learn C++ .

**Hire and Develop the Best** : 

**Insist on the Highest Standards** : Integeration Test, Envrionment

**Think Big** : Tiny Url for new id

**Bias for Action** : ci pipeline automation  

**Frugality** : SET save resource

**Earn Trust** : team workflow is 

**Dive Deep** : unused vector, should be one variable

**Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit** : duplication

**Deliver Results** : cache



performance = 个人效率 + 项目时间 + 人数

有问题都不是自己的问题

好的东西要利用，不好的东西要解决。

Story 01: distributed cache -> custom :other team. ownership, Deliver Result, Invent ans Simplify (Challenging)
Story 02: hadoop big data -> 
Story 03: cpc ctr problem
Story 04: Release one workflow with one client
Story 05: remote cross team project with London team -> management
Story 06: merge tab -> customer 
Story 07: privilege system
Story 08: dtrace profiling.
Story 09: run dtrace split and aggerator  (interesting)
Story 10: priority queue limitation
Story 11: compare tool algotrithm 
Story 12: SET --> Frugality, Earn Trust
Story 13: share script as internal tool

one mistake:

cpc ctr problem. focus on tech, ignore the business envrioment
priorityqueue top k, beta


Bloomberg:

copyRequest 1000 records with for loop: copyRequest 
30 s ==> 0.2 s

dev : 10 ms, 

prod:  7ms --> 2ms,

1300 machines 1 million


Create a new workflow...

new workflow, new share button for settings,

but the share privildge system is on process.

origin is on beta with 300 qps per machine.

Peek QPS : 1.5k


1. 分类讨论

2. 每一个问题都涉及到很多细节==> 要有枝干

速度 * 时间 = 产出量.

加了班，多加了一个人.


I ....

I drove the project.

3. 侧重点 => AWS, 一考试的思考.

develop new => 

4. C++ passion, 职业思考


不要拖后腿，创造产值.
