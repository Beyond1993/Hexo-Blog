Hi, My name is Wayne Feng, who is the Senior Software Engineer in Bloomberg Derivative Infrastruct Team. My job is to create and maintain the Redis distributed cache for MySQL cluster. I also normalize the workflow and optimize the C++ code to reduce the latency. 

Before I join Bloomberg, I am a Junior Software Engineer from Pinterest Search & Ads Team. In Pinterest, my job is building Big-Data pipeline for Ads Product from the log with Kafka, Spark, Hive, Cascading, then upload the data to Terrapin(A key-value storage maintained by Pinterest) or RocksDB. Whatâ€™s more, he tried some search experiments for search ads, such as n-gram token and blacklist experiment with Go.

I majored in computer science when I was in the stage of undergraduate in China, and got my master degree at Carnegie Mellon University on 05/17/2017

Right now I am active to  find a new opportunity in XXX. Thanks a lot for your attention!
