## Amazon 10 条军规
### 1. Customer Obsession: Business Integrity Appeal Project

1. set different groups for users. 
Help engineering reduce the Oncall number of ticket, let the good advertiser's ticket can be handled faster.

### 2.Dive Deep: Oncall OOM issue.

### 3. Bias for Action: 
Policy Center Platform, api data permission is waiting for approvel, hard code to demo
In the Policy Center Platform project,  
our service needs to call the Chinese team's API  
to retrieve data and display it in the Web UI.  

However, since the API permission is still awaiting approval  
and the Chinese team is on public holiday for the Spring Festival,  
I decided to temporarily hardcode the data  
in the backend for the demo scheduled for tomorrow.  

The user was satisfied with the sample data MVP  
and provided positive feedback.  

Through this experience, I learned to proactively  
consider holiday schedules and code freeze periods  
to better anticipate and mitigate potential delays in the future.

### 4. Insist on the highest standards: SLA 99.9% to 99.99 %
### 5. Ownership: Apple ID oncall
### 6. Earns Trust: Policy Center SOP

### 9. Have backbone, disagree and commit : compare tool algotrithm
### 10.Invent & Simplify: Rule Simplification from Jason to Domain language

## 不好的项目:
1. one mistake:
* cpc ctr problem. focus on tech, ignore the business envrioment, thresholde 

* priorityqueue top k, beta

2. Miss Deadline. It does not miss the deadline, PC platform, release the mvp first.

3. Conflicts:   PC platform Permission, Metrics for auditor, PM ask for all permission, but I think the core requirments is let auditor know the business impact, and how the regulation is applied in system. Some engineering permssion and metrics is not the key componenet

## Amazon AWS:
Automation Project:

The documentaion automation.

1. Conflict with PM. 
PM ask to do the full automation, but I think we can release mvp and waiting for feedback.

2. Miss Deadline:
System refactor, too many tasks and high risk, replace the rule engine first and then iterate.
Piroritize the tasks into smaller pieces and release mvp


## Tiktok Data Engineering 

1. Offline data backfill, different source data is not accurate
2. offline to online, QPS is high, urgent
3. real time counter.
