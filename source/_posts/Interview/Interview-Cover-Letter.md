Hi, Corinne Mullen 

I am a Software Engineer from Pinterest Search & Ads Team, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2017.
In Pinterest, My job is building big data pipeline for Ads Product from the log with Kafka, Spark, Hive, Cascading. And Then upload the data to Terrapin(A key-value storage maintained by Pinterest) or RockDB.

I also tried some search experiments for search ads, such as n-gram token and blacklist experiment.

I majored in computer science when I was an undergraduate student. I used to join a start-up in China as PHP / J2EE web application programmer. I built many different websites for many companies, and design the mobile online ordering system with WeChat API.

What’s more, I got an internship in Huawei and focused on and Distribute System
and cloud computing. I applied the Two-Phase Algorithm to ensure the consistency of MongoDB in Distribute System.

I am also familiar with C++ and python, I used it build some interesting application in the course of the university, such as the recommendation system with python, the speech recognition system with C++.

Right now I want to find a new opportunity in Microsoft. Mircosoft is the top international company, I am extremely interested in software position of Microsoft.  Could you please take a look at my resume, and provide an interview opportunity for me? Thanks very much!
Thank you for your attention！

Bests,
