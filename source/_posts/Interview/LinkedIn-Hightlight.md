Wayne started his career as a software engineer in Pinterest Ads team. Then he tried the Fintech area as Senior software engineer in Bloomberg Derivative Team. In Pinterest, he mainly worked on Big Data pipeline and Platform. In Bloomberg, he designed and implemented the distributed cache for Pricing Platform. He is really good at the algorithm and Big Data and Distributed Cache. I think he is good enough to join the InfraDev Tools team in Linkedin.
